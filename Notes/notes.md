# Study Notes

## Jots and Jibbles
### Workspaces
- A workspaces can be made to hold all of your files, executables, and settings within vs code. Right now I am using my study codespace. 
### Headers
- tell the compiler to include information about a library. 
### Functions
- contains *statements* that specify the computing operations to be done. 
- "main" is always where the program begins executing. It will usually call other functions to help. 
- some functions contain *arguments* parentheses to functions they call. 
- statements of the function are enclosed in braces { }. 
- scanf is asking for input. 
### Variables
- store the values to be used during the computation. 
- all must be declared before used, usually before executable statements.  
*A declaration announces the properties of variables; it consists of a type name and a list of variables eg int fahr, celsius*
- int, float, char, short, long, double, are examples of *variables*. 
- They have names %d, %f, %c, %hd, %ld, %lf repectively. 

### Side Quest and GPT Notes:

<summary>Speaking Input in C</summary>

#### Basics: 

- fgets(text, size, stdin); → gets what the user types.  
- system("say ..."); → makes the Mac speak text.  
- Strings in C = just arrays of characters (like char text[100];).  

#### New Terms: 
- buffer → a place in memory to store data (like user input).  
- stdin → standard input = the keyboard.  
- escape sequence → special characters starting with \ (e.g. \n = new line).  

#### For now, remember:  
- Use fgets to read input.  
- Use system("say ...") to speak it.

<summary>Building a Website</summary>

#### Wordpress: 
- easy and can make money quickly for clients. Sounds fancy, but its mostly themes and plugins. 
- minimal coding mostly css and php. 
- very fast to launch. 
- great for small biz, blogs or portfolios. 
- Income from freelancing, agency work, maintenance. 

#### Fullstack Web Dev: 
- front end requires html, css, javascript, frameworks like react
- back end requires node.js, python, 
- api and databases
- high learning curve
- slower to launch, but more flexible
- best for custom apps, startups, and unique platforms
- Income from freelancing, development jobs, and startups.
